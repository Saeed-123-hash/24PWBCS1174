In this lab I learned how to use Git to track changes in my project files. I created and managed files such as `index.html`, `.gitignore`, and `LICENSE`. I practiced staging, committing, and pushing changes to GitHub. Working with branches, I made experimental changes safely without affecting the main branch. This exercise helped me understand how Git tracks file creation, updates, and deletions in a real project.
